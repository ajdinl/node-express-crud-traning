# Node Express CRUD Traning

Welcome to my training repository designed to enhance my skills in Node.js and Express development.
This project includes functionalities for managing users and posts, empowering each user to create, view, edit, and delete their own posts.

To get started with this project, begin by cloning it to your local machine using the following terminal command:

```
git clone git@github.com:ajdinl/node-express-crud-traning.git
```

Next, ensure you register on www.mongodb.com and follow the instructions provided on the site to establish a connection (Connect). Copy the MongoDB URI into the .env file.

In your terminal, execute `npm install`, and once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the project using `npm run dev`. Following this setup, the project will be ready for testing (e.g., using Postman) or deployment."
